<p>
As the Admin, view the ticket. Decide which agent will service the ticket (Mary Charles in this case). Decide the SLA level and revise the Help Topic if needed. This gives the agent more information about the severity of the problem.

<p>
Mary Charles signs in to osTicket. She sees she has a new ticket. She reviews that ticket and also sees she needs to supply a backup laptop for Fred to work on while she inspect his current laptop. Mary logs her work in the ticket tread as she goes.
